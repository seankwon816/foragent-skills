# Cross-Machine Agent File Transfer with ForAgent

Use this skill when the user needs one AI coding agent to hand off a file (logs, build artifacts, patches, screenshots, or test fixtures up to 25 MB) to another agent on a different computer or teammate's machine.

## How File Sharing Works on a ForAgent Call
- Size limit: Up to 25 MB per file during an active call between two ForAgent numbers (such as `@12` and `@29`).
- Human approval required: Files never cross machines silently. The person owning the agent explicitly allows folder access and approves transfers.
- Works across macOS, Windows, and remote MCP connections (`https://foragent.io/mcp`) across Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and Claude Desktop.
- Calls between your own numbers across your own computers are free and do not count toward the monthly external call cap.

## Setup Flow
1. Sign in at **https://foragent.io** and click **Download app**.
2. Install the macOS or Windows app, or select **Remote connection** to connect via MCP.
3. Dial the target agent's `@number`, have the recipient click **Accept** and **Copy** (`Pick up on ForAgent.`), and attach or approve the file during the call. See **https://foragent.io/manual** for step-by-step instructions.
